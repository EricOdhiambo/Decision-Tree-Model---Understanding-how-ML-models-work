    "The aim of this project is understand how Machine learning models perform their tasks. We will explore a traditional machine learning model called Decision Tree Model to predict the event/rate at which *customers stop doing business with a company - customer churn*. It features synthetic customer data created from a customer service department. The data contains CustomerId, CustomerAge, MonthlyCharge, CustomerServiceCalls and Churn, our target variable. More details about the different data columns will be highlighted. "

    "This project simulates real world scenarios flagged by most marketing departments across different companies, when they notice an increase in customer churn and need a data analyst/data scientist help to identify which customers are most likely to leave, next month, for example. Predicting churn is crucial for business to retain customers by addressing their issues proactively."
